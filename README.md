# Problem Statement
To help cycle retailers market their cycles to reach more customers, this cycle management system provides a sweet user friendly interface to let owners add stocks, price them accordingly, add cycle images, etc. Users can login and view cycles from different categories(boys,girls,kids) and place enquiry for the cycles they like. 
Admin/Owner can see the users and their requests in admin panel and thus can contact them to make a deal.

### Install flask, sqlite3, python and run application.py to play around with the app :)

# P.S.
master branch uses sqlite3 for database
Feel free to check "mysqlbranch" for implementation using mysql.
This app is also deployed in heroku. [Click here](https://cycledb.herokuapp.com)
